### Hi there 👋

<!--
**lundeen-bryan/lundeen-bryan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ("CSS - The Complete Guide 2020 (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass)")[https://www.udemy.com/course/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/] by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Udemy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS in more depth.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any learning project, I'm interested in front end web dev but also have C# and VBA skills.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding an entry level job in web dev.
- 💬 Ask me about what projects I've worked on that are NOT in GitHub.
- 📫 How to reach me: GitHub for now. 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I designed a program for our hospital that helps save a lot of time processing doctors reports.
