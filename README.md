### Hi there, I'm Bryan 👋

Here is a little bit about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ["Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)"](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/) by Brad Traversy on Udemy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS in more depth.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any learning project, I'm interested in front end web dev but also have C# and VBA skills.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding an entry level job in web dev.
- 💬 Ask me about what projects I've worked on that are NOT in GitHub.
- 📫 How to reach me: GitHub for now. 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I designed a program for our hospital that helps save a lot of time processing doctors reports.
